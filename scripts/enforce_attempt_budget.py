"""Fail-fast budget for repeated failed re-encode dispatches of one citation.

Motivation (axiom-encode#1495): individual citations burned 20-31 targeted
re-encode runs in a single week at API prices, all of them ad hoc
dispatches retrying a persistently failing gate. This guard runs as a
cheap unprotected job before the production-signing environment gate and
before any model call. When the same citation has already failed
``attempt_budget`` consecutive times (no intervening success) inside the
lookback window, an ad hoc dispatch is blocked with triage instructions.

Queue-driven dispatches never reach this script in CI — the
attempt_budget job's own condition skips them so the guard can never
stall a tranche. The ``queue_id`` report-only branch below survives as
defense in depth for odd dispatch paths and local use.

Repair replays are report-only here. Their prior-run identity and preserved
candidate are authenticated by the protected resolver before any model call,
so they must be able to reach that resolver even when fresh attempts are
exhausted.

The guard is a cost damper, not a security gate: if the GitHub API cannot
be reached it fails open with a loud warning. Stdlib-only because it runs
on a bare runner before any toolchain setup.
