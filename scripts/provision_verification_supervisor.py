"""Build a protected verification-supervisor execution tree.

The load-bearing guarantee is EMPIRICAL: the provisioned launcher interpreter is
run under a minimal environment and ``/proc/self/maps`` is required to show it
maps its OWN binary from the root-owned runtime, maps NO file from the
(user-writable) source prefix, and pins any mapped ``libpython`` to the runtime —
even under a hostile ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``. This bounds the launcher interpreter's
own load-time closure; it does NOT assert that every mapping is inside the runtime
(the root-owned system loader and libc legitimately map from ``/lib``, ``/usr/lib``).
The check observes exactly what the loader does (interpreter, every mapped library,
audit hooks, ``$ORIGIN`` expansion) with no dependence on hand-parsed ELF metadata.
The static passes below make that outcome reachable and durable:

* Source prefix: a system/FHS prefix, a prefix outside ``--require-prefix-under``,
  one exceeding the file cap, or one whose tree escapes itself via a symlink is
  refused BEFORE any copy.
* Startup code: every ``.pth``/``._pth``/``.egg-link``/``pyvenv.cfg``/
  ``pybuilddir.txt``/``__editable__*`` path-configuration carrier, the canonical
  stdlib ``pythonXY[t].zip``, and every importable ``sitecustomize``/
  ``usercustomize`` form (module, package dir, ``.pyc``, extension module) is
  purged AFTER the staged site-packages swap, so the launcher's ``-I``
  (site-enabled) start executes none of them.
* Run paths: every copied ELF whose ``DT_RPATH``/``DT_RUNPATH`` (read via
  ``patchelf --print-rpath``) escapes the runtime after per-object ``$ORIGIN``
  expansion — requiring both lexical and symlink-resolved containment — is
  repinned to ``<runtime>/lib`` as a forced ``DT_RPATH`` (which ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``
  cannot outrank), then re-read to confirm nothing still escapes. This neutralizes
  the toolchain's absolute build-prefix RUNPATH so ``libpython`` loads from the
  runtime, and is the pass the maps check then verifies for the launcher.

Trust boundary and residual: the inputs are the GitHub-provided toolcache stdlib
and pinned pip dependencies, and the finished tree is chowned root and stripped
of group/other write by the caller (the supervisor re-verifies that ownership).
A pinned dependency carrying hostile ELF metadata (an absolute ``DT_NEEDED``, a
``DT_AUDIT`` hook, a decoy section) is NOT statically audited here — such a
dependency already executes its own code inside the signer, so metadata-level
auditing adds no protection beyond the dependency-provenance trust already
extended, and the run-path repin plus root-ownership bound the writable-path
vectors that do matter.
