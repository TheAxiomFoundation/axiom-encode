"""Console-script dispatch for the ``axiom-encode`` command.

``pyproject.toml`` points the ``axiom-encode`` script here. Subcommands
implemented outside :mod:`axiom_encode.cli` are dispatched first; every
other invocation delegates to :func:`axiom_encode.cli.main` with
``sys.argv`` untouched, so the main command surface behaves exactly as if
it were registered directly.
