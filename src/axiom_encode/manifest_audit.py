"""Audit every committed encoding manifest against the file it attests.

The apply guard (``guard-generated``) asks *"is there a matching attestation
for this changed file?"*.  One good record answers that question, and the guard
says nothing about the other records committed alongside it.  So a rule can be
re-generated, gain a fresh manifest in a new location, and leave its previous
manifest behind asserting a hash the file no longer has — with CI green.

This module asks the auditor's question instead: **does every committed
attestation match its file?**  Two invariants implement it:

``every attestation matches``
    Every ``applied_files[]`` entry in every committed manifest must resolve to
    a tracked regular file whose sha256 equals the attested value (or, for a
    deletion marker, to no filesystem entry at all).

``at most one live manifest per rule path``
    Two live manifests attesting the same file is the ambiguity that let the
    first invariant rot unnoticed: the guard found the good record and never
    looked at the bad one.  Superseded records are pruned, or their superseded
    claims are retired in place; they are not accumulated.

The audit is deliberately **schema- and signature-agnostic**.  It hashes files
and compares bytes.  Signature and schema validity are enforced by the apply
guard; re-checking them here would make the audit inherit the guard's blind
spot — the current verifier accepts only the newest manifest schema, while
whole repos of live records predate it, which is precisely where stale claims
accumulate.  Agnostic does not mean permissive: a ``.json`` under any manifest
tree that is not a well-formed, non-empty, internally consistent apply manifest
reachable without symlinks fails the audit rather than being skipped, so a
record cannot be blanked, aliased, or linked out of existence.

A claim that is superseded but cannot be deleted — the record also carries the
only attestation for a *sibling* file, so deleting it would destroy a true
record — is **retired in place** by an entry in
``.axiom/retired-manifest-claims.yaml``.  A retired claim is no longer live: it
does not count toward uniqueness and its staleness is not a finding.  An entry
is a reviewed exception and nothing more.  It names one exact ``(manifest,
path, attested sha256)`` claim, verifies nothing, authorizes nothing, and is
accepted only while it is still real: the claim must exist in the manifest
with that exact digest; a still-true claim may be retired only if another
live record attests the file's current content; and a stale claim whose file
has no matching live attestation at all must say so (``unattested: true``).
An entry that stops meeting those conditions fails the audit, so the list is
removal-forced.  It is not growth-capped: additions arrive only in reviewed
diffs (or as the apply transaction's own artifact, alongside the successor
manifest that justifies them), and the file cannot bind an author with write
access — pull-request review does that.  What the audit guarantees is that
every tolerated divergence is enumerated, exact, and visible.
