# Issue 1312 progress

## State

The checkout-root routing and ProgramSpec citation fix is implemented and
verified end to end. Actual checkout-root source directories use a narrow
source-checkout admission mode without weakening normal canonical routing;
mixed root/jurisdiction layouts and symlink rejection are covered. The
terminal version is 0.2.1407, focused checks pass, and the independent
review-fix cycle has no remaining actionable findings. The exact origin diff
has been audited and the required untracked worker report is complete.

## Done

- Created the requested local branch and isolated worktree from `origin/main`.
- Read the repository instructions and applicable debugging/GitHub workflows.
- Established the fail-first, implementation, real-checkout, compatibility,
  validation, and independent-review plan.
- Read issue 1312, rulespec-us PR 1139, issue 1078, and the committed Arizona
  ProgramSpec manifest that establishes checkout-root placement and a bare
  `programs/...` citation.
- Confirmed the pinned bridge mechanism: the ProgramSpec has no leading
  jurisdiction prefix, falls back to `<checkout>/us`, and fails while rebasing
  `<checkout>/programs/...`; its anchor is also incorrectly `us:programs/...`.
- Located the exact held-out SC change in rulespec-us reflog commit `f93f556c`:
  add page 159/remove page 369 in the ProgramSpec and drain three worklist rows.
- Added current-main regressions for the signed ProgramSpec manifest, the four
  requested checkout-root source roots, and checkout-root placement while
  retaining the UK and jurisdiction-content-root controls.
- Captured the fail-first focused run: six failures, including the exact
  `programs/us-sc/snap/fy-2026.yaml` writer case.
- Recorded that `uv run` cannot access `~/.cache/uv` in the sandbox; focused
  current-main tests run with an existing compatible project environment.
- Routed checkout-owned `policies/`, `programs/`, `regulations/`, and
  `statutes/` outputs through the exact checkout root, taught manifest
  placement to accept that root, and made ProgramSpec citations bare
  `programs/...` paths.
- Added the issue 1312 changelog entry.
- Passed the focused current-main regression plus the jurisdiction-prefixed and
  UK issue-1078 controls: nine tests passed; focused Ruff also passed.
- Reconstructed the exact two-file SC change on rulespec-us base
  `187d8d8e`: page 159 entered/page 369 left the ProgramSpec scope and all
  three `SNAP-SC-UTIL` worklist rows changed to `merged`.
- Captured the literal pinned-bridge fail-first: exit 1 at the reported
  `path.relative_to(manifest_root)` line because the root ProgramSpec was
  rebased against `<scratch>/us`.
- Applied the minimal routing/citation backport to a disposable pinned checkout,
  followed by a scratch-only version bump required by its clean-provenance
  gate; the campaign interpreter then signed the reconstructed diff.
- Confirmed the v1 output shape: checkout-root
  `.axiom/encoding-manifests/programs/us-sc/snap/fy-2026.json`, bare
  `programs/us-sc/snap/fy-2026` citation, and checkout-relative applied path.
- Committed the manifest only in the disposable rulespec clone and passed the
  separate external `guard-generated --roots programs` check.
- Confirmed the source `wt-snap-sc` worktree remains unchanged apart from its
  two pre-existing untracked report files.
- Completed the first independent review pass. It found that the initial
  four-root test did not create real atomic roots and that resolving the input
  path before admission weakened symlink rejection.
- Added a narrowly scoped checkout inspection mode for manifest-owned source
  roots while preserving the normal rule that only ProgramSpecs are admitted
  at checkout root, restored lexical admission, and added real-file,
  symlink-rejection, direct `us-sc/policies/...`, and direct `uk/statutes/...`
  coverage.
- Passed all 14 strengthened focused routing/writer/compatibility tests.
- The second review pass found two additional mixed-layout safety gaps:
  jurisdiction-prefixed files failed when the same checkout also had a
  root-level atomic source directory, and the checkout-root helper resolved a
  symlink alias before admission. Captured both as three failing cases, then
  fixed them with scoped direct-child routing and lexical validation.
- Passed the final routing, writer, issue-1078, repository-routing, and version
  provenance matrix: 57 tests passed.
- Coordinated the terminal encoder version as 0.2.1407 in `pyproject.toml`,
  `src/axiom_encode/__init__.py`, and `uv.lock`, after all encoder-affecting
  commits.
- Passed full Ruff, `compileall`, and `git diff --check`.
- Ran all 6,091 repository tests with an available offline compatible
  environment and writable scratch Go cache: 6,024 passed and 31 skipped.
  Of 36 failures, the sole branch-caused version-provenance failure was fixed
  and rerun green; the other 35 are confined to the environment's stale
  `axiom-oracles`/editable install and sandbox-dependent system/provisioning
  checks.
- Completed the final independent review pass after the mixed-layout fix and
  terminal version bump; both reviewers reported no remaining actionable
  findings.
- Verified the exact `origin/main..HEAD` name-only diff and clean tracked
  state, then wrote the required untracked `WORKER-REPORT.md`.

## Next

- No implementation work remains; deliver the local head and report.
