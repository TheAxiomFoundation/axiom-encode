EncodeBench execution identity v3 now binds the effective Claude, Codex, and
OpenAI timeout policies, the per-case generation/retry wall budget, and
generation retry limits. That budget charges each attempt's source, workspace,
and prompt setup and bounds backend waits, OpenAI requests and backoffs,
responses that arrive after the deadline, artifact materialization,
empty-artifact retries, and all suite retries. Artifacts whose materialization
crosses the deadline are securely discarded from both the result tree and any
direct-write backend workspace, then persist as terminal case-budget timeouts.
Each runner-case receives an independent fresh budget, so runner order and
runner-set membership cannot consume another runner's allowance or suppress its
retries. Deterministic artifact validation and optional reviewers pause rather
than consume the generation budget, so they cannot suppress a permitted
generation retry and are not misrepresented as preemptible work.
Capability boards require the complete v3 identity, validate every nested
checkout and nonempty directory RuleSpec-root field, verify the complete sealed
PolicyEngine runtime-v2 identity and wrapper digest (including its canonical
repository and trusted import-path topology), require that runtime whenever
result rows carry PolicyEngine oracle evidence, and refuse missing or unexpected
toolchain fields. Admission also mirrors the producer's official/checkout tree
count equality, canonical RuleSpec runtime-pin path bound to an exact exposed
RuleSpec execution root (with lexical traversal refused), pin bytes included in
that checkout's scoped identity and cross-checked by digest, and
Python-version/stdlib binding. Cross-host PolicyEngine paths normalize to stable
semantic anchors while import order, relative module origins, and sealed-root
layout remain score-affecting. Git checkout identities must carry exactly the
producer-owned scope for the encoder and each RuleSpec root, while the rules
engine must remain whole-checkout scoped; real producer-to-board admission locks
protect both contracts. Checkout origins are either absent or use the producer's
canonical `github.com/<owner>/<repo>` spelling. RuleSpec execution roots must be
direct jurisdiction children of a matching `rulespec-<country>` checkout with
that jurisdiction as the first scoped path, and each durable row must use the
root matching its citation jurisdiction. PolicyEngine rows additionally bind
the runtime country, exact RuleSpec checkout pin path, and pin digest to that
same admitted root. Every durable row's admission context must bind back to
the suite's exact run, manifest, case, corpus, RuleSpec root, runner set,
execution identity, and digest, and PolicyEngine metrics must bind to that same
sealed runtime with a required pass outcome and runtime evidence (the score
remains optional) rather than a producer-impossible partial combination.
Case identities now expose and bind each case's oracle declaration. Capability
boards reject successful PolicyEngine cases that omit oracle evidence while
allowing failed pre-artifact cases to remain outside artifact and oracle
denominators.
CLI report admission now delegates execution and row checks to the same strict
v3 consumer used by capability boards, including scalar and metric types,
artifact bindings, canonical RuleSpec topology, per-row root jurisdiction,
PolicyEngine runtime, and timeout/retry policy validation.
That shared row admission also binds each result's top-level citation to the
canonical corpus citation in its authenticated case identity.
Terminal encoder timeout evidence stops suite-level retries, bounding Claude
and Codex timeout paths to the two documented artifact-generation attempts
instead of six.
Runtime retry loops now consume the same bound constants, and completed
historical runs recover their digest-verified suite retry count before
rebuilding the live identity, so nondefault policies remain verifiable without
trusting other persisted execution fields.
